# timewatch

A stopwatch app made for `flexular` that lets you track multiple timers independently.
<br>
The stopwatches stop and get saved upon quitting the app or leaving to another module/app of `flexular`.

For each timer, you can provide a tag (a string of text) to remember what the stopwatch is for.
