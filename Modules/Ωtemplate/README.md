# template

An example template module/app for `flexular`, showcasing how the HTML and JS works with `flexular`.

As mentioned in the main README, `index.html` in the root of your module will be the first page that it is opened up to when navigated to by the side bar, and `index.js` in the root of your module is run in the backend when the app is opened.

To install and use Node.JS modules, put any dependencies into `package.json`.

The folder name is prepended with `Î©` to make it go to the bottom of the list (since modules are ordered alphabetically) in the app.
